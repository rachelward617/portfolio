# Data Science & Data Analytics Portfolio 
## by Rachel Ward

This portfolio is a compilation of coursework and independent projects, divided by subject matter for ease of reference.

## Regression Models

### Power Plant Energy Production Prediction
For [this project](https://github.com/rachelward617/DAV-6150/blob/master/R_Ward_M2_Assn.ipynb) I was tasked with predicting the energy production of a power plant. I was given a dataset originally from UC Irvine, and had to clean the data, perform Exploratory Data Analysis ("EDA"), select variables, and create two different linear regression models. I also had to cross-validate said models.

### City MPG Prediction
In [this project](https://github.com/rachelward617/DAV-6150/blob/master/S_Ferrari_M_Vizelman_R_Ward_M4_Assn_v5.ipynb) my team members and I were tasked with predicting city miles per gallon for vehicles based on a dataset from UC Irvine. After performing EDA, we used various feature selection methods and dimensionality reduction techniques to see which combination of features yielded the best linear regression model.

### Loan Application Approval Prediction
For [this assignment](https://github.com/rachelward617/DAV-6150/blob/master/S_Ferrari_M_Vizelman_R_Ward_M7_Assn.ipynb) my team members and I were tasked with predicting whether or not an individual would be approved for a loan. To do so we performed the normal data science life cycle, creating multiple logistic regression models, and determining which assessment made the most sense given our objective. 

## KNN and SVM Classification Models

### Loan Application Discrimation
Using the dataset mentioned in the above loan application approval prediction project, my colleagues and I created [SVM and KNN classification models](https://github.com/rachelward617/DAV-6150/blob/master/S_Ferrari_M_Vizelman_R_Ward_M8_Assn.ipynb) to determine whether there was any bias present in the loan application process. 

## Neural Networks

### Diamond Cut Prediction
For [this project](https://github.com/rachelward617/DAV-6150/blob/master/S_Ferrari_M_Vizelman_R_Ward_M13_Assn.ipynb) my team members and I were tasked with comparing and contrasting the performance of three separate feed-forward/back propogating neural networks with the cut of a diamond as the response variable.

## General Data Analytics

### The Influence of Super PACs in the 2016 Presidential Election
[This was my final project](https://github.com/rachelward617/DAV-5400/blob/master/R_Ward_FinalProject_FINAL.ipynb) of my analytics programming course. For my final project I analyzed donations to super PACs by individuals in the state of Ohio on a county basis to see if there was any correlation between the amount of donations to a candidate (or party) in that county and which candidate won that county in the presidential election.

## Visualizations

### Housing Prices in Cordoba, Argentina
As part of our [final project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rachel.ward3031/viz/R_Ward_J_Ruggiero_Final_Project_Tableau/Dashboard) in an Auto ML course, my classmate and I built this dashboard to allow the user to explore the housing prices in Cordoba, Argentina. This dashboard was the culminating visualization after first using Alteryx to clean and prep the data, and Data Robot to build machine learning models. In addition, [the presentation of this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ-wYqiKCfE) is now shown to students matriculating in the Data Analytics & Visualization program at Yeshiva University as an example of presentation technique. 

### Covid 19, Unemployment, and the Stock Market
This [interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rachel.ward3031/viz/UnitedStatesCovid19UnemploymenttheStockMarket/Dashboard) was created as the culminating visual of my final project in an Information Architecures course. I first created a data warehouse using AWS, Python, MySQL, and batch files that refreshed all data sources overnight and fed into this Tableau dashboard. The dashboard allows the user to look at unemployment claims, covid cases, covid deaths, and stock market performance by state.
